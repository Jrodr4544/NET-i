# NET-i

# Description

This application is used for providing a quick reference guide for anyone who has a network with many assets. They can also see the different contacts in case of any emergencies or change requests. Its feature for dashboard may provide quick details about their environment(s).

# Quick start

Install the gems required after cloning 
by running:

bundle install

After installing the gems start a local server using rails or your preference, but in order to comply with the api keys bind it to localhost:3000 which rails does by default.

rails server -b localhost

# For assessment

This might only be able to run locally since the api keys in place are 'exclusive'. Might only be available from IP addresses I provided to APIs (specifically google maps)
